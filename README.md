## 📚 About ThinkDSA

ThinkDSA is a minimalist, developer-first tool built to support thoughtful learning. Rather than racing for green ticks, we help learners:

- 🧠 Reflect before solving with pseudocode-first thinking
- 🔗 Organize problems from LeetCode, GFG, etc.
- 🤖 Get gentle AI feedback using Gemini API
- 📈 Track topics, progress, and mindset over time

---

## 🧩 Why Build This?

There are hundreds of coding platforms, but:

- Most learners feel overwhelmed by scattered resources.
- People often forget what they’ve already done.
- Copying answers becomes a crutch, not a learning tool.
- Feedback on "how to think better" is missing.

**ThinkDSA solves these by encouraging real thinking, personal tracking, and incremental learning.**

---

## ✨ Features

- 📋 Organize problems by custom topics
- 🔍 Smart scraping for metadata & question details
- 🧑‍🏫 Pseudocode editor with AI-driven iterative feedback
- 🧠 AI suggestions to deepen problem understanding
- 🖼️ Split-panel layout for focused thinking
- 🌓 Light and dark themes, minimal UI
- 🔐 Auth via Firebase or Auth0

- 📏 Local scroll containers (avoid full-page scrolls)
- 🌓 Respect user/system themes
- 🧠 Feedback as guidance — never full solutions

---
